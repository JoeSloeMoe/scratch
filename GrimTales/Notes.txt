Grim Tales 7DTD XML mod. (JoeSLoeMoe)
Forum:

A small collection of short stories that give a glimpse into the lives/deaths of other survivors.
	1) Missing Patrol Car - break into a number of Cop Cars without lockpicking to engage. 
	2) Mary's Revenge - triggered at a 3000 Kill Streak (configurable). Kill Streak resets on death.
	3) Pigeons Carry Diseases - pigeons: some people hate them and some people absolutely adore them.
	4) Interloper - keeping your eyes and ears open can lead to interesting things.
	
Notes:
- The stories introduce unique items mid-late game.
- These are not Trader quests or missions. They occur as you play the game. 
- This is an XML mod and some of the storytelling is bounded by the capabilities of the XML.
- The mod has not been tested in a multiplayer environment. Feedback on this is welcome.

License:
The code is free to use and commented with that in mind. A thank you would be nice if you reuse the code/patterns.
